# Trelly — Trello CLI and MCP server

Manage Trello from a terminal or an AI agent. Trelly includes a human-friendly CLI,
an interactive kanban UI, structured JSON output, and a local MCP server.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g trelly
# or
brew install brandonkramer/tap/trelly
```

Node.js 22+ is required. You can also run Trelly without installing it with
`npx trelly` or `bunx trelly`.

To run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandonkramer/trelly.git
cd trelly
bun install
./bin/trelly --help
```

## Authenticate

```bash
trelly auth setup
trelly auth login
trelly boards list
```

`auth setup` opens Trello's Power-Up admin page so you can create an API key.
`auth login` then opens Trello in your browser to authorize your account.

Credentials are stored with mode `600` in `~/.config/trelly/config.json`. Trelly
supports multiple profiles; use `trelly auth login --profile work` and pass
`--profile work` to commands.

Run `trelly auth --help` for manual login, full-access tokens, environment variables,
and profile management.

## Use the CLI

```bash
trelly boards list
trelly boards lists BOARD_ID
trelly cards create --list LIST_ID --name "Ship feature"
trelly cards move CARD_ID --list LIST_ID
trelly cards comment CARD_ID --text "Shipped"
trelly cards add-attachment CARD_ID --file screenshot.png
trelly search "customer onboarding"
```

Human-readable output is the default. Use `--json` for scripts:

```bash
trelly --json --pretty boards list | jq '.data'
```

JSON responses use `{ ok, profile, data }`; errors use `{ ok: false, error, ... }`
and exit with status `1`. Colors automatically turn off when output is piped.

Trelly covers boards, lists, cards, comments, attachments, checklists, labels,
custom fields, members, organizations, actions, search, and webhooks. The raw
`trelly api` command is available for endpoints without a dedicated command.

Run `trelly --help` or `trelly <group> --help` for the complete command reference.
Prefer `archive` commands, which are reversible, over permanent `delete` commands.

## Open the kanban UI

```bash
trelly              # choose a board
trelly ui BOARD_ID  # open a board directly
```

Use arrow keys or `hjkl` to navigate, Enter to open a card, `r` to refresh, and
`q` or Esc to go back. Card detail supports comments, replies, and attachments.

## Connect AI agents

Install the Trelly plugin for your local agent hosts:

```bash
trelly install                 # choose detected hosts
trelly install --cursor
trelly install --claude
trelly install --codex
trelly install --all --yes     # non-interactive
trelly install --check         # inspect only
```

The installer configures the plugin and MCP server, then prints the required reload
instructions. See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for platform-specific setup,
verification, and troubleshooting.

Check or apply updates with:

```bash
trelly update --check
trelly update        # asks before changing anything
trelly update --yes  # non-interactive
```

Updates use the package manager that owns the installation and refresh only detected
plugins. Dirty source checkouts are not changed automatically.

## Configure MCP directly

If you do not want the plugin, add Trelly to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trelly": {
      "command": "trelly-mcp",
      "env": { "TRELLO_PROFILE": "default" }
    }
  }
}
```

See [mcp.example.json](mcp.example.json) for a complete example. From a source clone,
use the absolute path to `bin/trelly-mcp`.

The server provides 30 focused tools for profiles, boards, lists, cards, comments,
attachments, checklists, labels, search, webhooks, ID resolution, and raw REST calls.
Context tools combine common reads so agents need fewer requests.

Successful GET requests use bounded, short-lived caches: in-process for MCP and on disk
for the CLI at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/trelly/responses` (or `~/.cache/trelly/responses`).
Cards are cached for 15 seconds, comments and attachments for 10 seconds, search for 20
seconds, and boards, lists, and labels for 1 minute. MCP also deduplicates concurrent
requests. Pass `fresh: true` to an MCP read or the global CLI flag `--fresh` for a network
read. Set `TRELLO_CACHE=0` to disable caching. Errors and mutations are never cached;
successful mutations invalidate related reads.

See [the MCP skill](skills/trelly-mcp/SKILL.md) for tool details, safety guidance,
and when to use MCP instead of the CLI.

## Trello Power-Up

The optional companion Power-Up at [tr3lly.dev](https://tr3lly.dev) adds card-link,
card-ID, snapshot, attachment, and badge actions inside Trello. It is separate from
the local CLI and MCP server and does not request their credentials.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for its data handling and hosting details.
